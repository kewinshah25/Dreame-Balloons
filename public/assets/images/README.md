# Image assets for deployment

Add these files here so they are included in the repo and in GitHub Pages deployment:

- **balloon1.png** – hero & contact form balloon graphic
- **balloon2.png** – hero & contact form balloon graphic
- **hero.jpg** – hero section background

The Next.js workflow builds with `output: 'export'`, which copies everything in `public/` into the deployed `out/` folder. Commit these image files to get them on the live site.
